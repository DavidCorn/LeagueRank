    "Nowadays, League of Legends (LOL) is probably the most popular online MOBA game in the world, with over 67 million players every month. LOL is a real-time competing game, which requires skills and strategy. Thus, knowing about your ability and skills is important for people who want to reach a higher level, especially for the professional players. Currently, Riot Games (the producer of LOL) has only provided rank score to estimate the players integrated level. For specific champions' level, there's no official tools to precisely evaluate that. This project is aimed to reveal the players most frequently played champions' level and give players a guidance of how to horn his/her skills.\n",

    "For background knowledge, there are some terminology that need to be clarified:\n",
    "- **Summoner:** the player\n",
    "- **Champion:** the character summoner uses during the game\n",
    "- **Tier:** the level a summoner is in currently. There are seven tiers currently, from low to high: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master and challenger.\n",
    "- **Division:** the sub-level a summoner is in. For example, bronze to diamond have 5 divisions, represented using Roman numbers (I-V), whereas master and challenger have only one division."
